WARNING :   DEPRECATED FEATURE: flwr.simulation.start_simulation() is deprecated.
        Instead, use the `flwr run` CLI command to start a local simulation in your Flower app, as shown for example below:

                $ flwr new  # Create a new Flower app from a template

                $ flwr run  # Run the Flower app in Simulation Mode

        Using `start_simulation()` is deprecated.

            This is a deprecated feature. It will be removed
            entirely in future versions of Flower.
