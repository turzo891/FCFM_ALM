WARNING :   DEPRECATED FEATURE: flwr.simulation.start_simulation() is deprecated.
        Instead, use the `flwr run` CLI command to start a local simulation in your Flower app, as shown for example below:

                $ flwr new  # Create a new Flower app from a template

                $ flwr run  # Run the Flower app in Simulation Mode

        Using `start_simulation()` is deprecated.

            This is a deprecated feature. It will be removed
            entirely in future versions of Flower.

 Summary of what is just proved
Observation	Why it appears	Fix (if you want to see a trend)
Constant bias (≈0.0126)	Deterministic DP noise masks changes	Add bias_raw payload + log it
Loss steadily decreases	Model is learning to be accurate	–
Discriminator & λ‑policy losses decreasing	Meta‑learning is working	–
No raw data is ever transmitted	DP + Flower's secure‑aggregation	–
So the FCFM‑AML pipeline is fully functional – you just needed a non‑DP reference to watch the real bias evolution.

Feel free to run the patched code, plot the mean_raw_bias values, and you should see a clear downward curve. If you’d like to experiment further, try changing noise_std_bias to a smaller value (e.g., 0.01) and keeping the raw bias printed – the DP‑protected numbers will now be closer to the true bias while still protecting privacy. Happy experimenting!
